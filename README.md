# Project Euler Repo

This is a repo where I keep my project Eulers code solutions.

## Explanation

Euler was an 18th century Swiss mathematician, physicist, astronomer, geographer, logician and engineer. He was an important scientist who's name is not known to most people.

Project Euler is a list of logical/mathemetical problems that can be solved with code. For each problem you have to come up with an alorithm to come to the desired outcome.

## Outline

I will put each problem in it's own file heading the file with a comment outlining the problem and the disired outcome, sometimes with an example in- and output and intermediate steps.

## Plans

I plan on making a type of blog site where each blog post represents a problem from the project Euler (perhaps multiple blog posts for harder problems). As so far there are 703 problems in project Euler, I will not soon run out of source material. But seeing that the latter problems ony have been solved by a hand full or a few hunderd people I don't see myself reaching the end in this lifetime.
